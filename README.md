# KNN Distance Function and Comparison with Other Classifiers

This coursework was done in a Jupyter Notebook and uses Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and SkLearn.

## Task 1

The task asked for a custom distance function to be created for use with a KNN classifier. Multiple KNN classifiers were then created using the custom distance function, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Chebyshev distance. They were then tested and had their accuracy score's compared with 1, 3, 5, and 7 neighbours.

## Task 2

The task compared a KNN classifier, a DT classifier, and a MLP classifier. Their average accuracy scores were compared in a graph.
